poliastro wishes everyone a merry new revolution around the Sun! ðŸ’«

During the December break, Juan Luis wrote [a new example on how to read OMM and TLE
data](https://docs.poliastro.space/en/latest/examples/Loading%20OMM%20and%20TLE%20satellite%20data.html)
that will help with a number of typical satellite observation use cases and
merged [a few refactors](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/1434)
[and cleanups](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/1430) of the source code.
We expect to make a 0.16.1 release soon to ship the documentation improvements,
and will keep cleaning up the code over the coming weeks and addressing some
long-standing issues.

In addition, Sebastian will kick off [the project to add array types to
poliastro](https://github.com/poliastro/documents/blob/master/numfocus-sdg-2021-r3.md)
very soon. This work will be possible thanks to the generous funding of
NumFOCUS, and will improve the performance of the library for some use cases.
