It fills us with astronomical joy to announce the release of poliastro 0.16.0! ðŸš€

This release shipped numerous new APIs and performance improvements. Yash, our
Google Summer of Code 2021 student,  added a number of event detectors for
numerical propagation, and several contributors helped accelerate more parts of
the code, which should result in significant speedups for most workflows. In
addition, we have new community-contributed scripts for relative orbits and mean
elements computations.

[You can read 0.16.0 full release notes online](https://docs.poliastro.space/en/v0.16.0/changelog.html#poliastro-0-16-0-2021-12-08).

We will present these changes at the
[Open Source Cubesat Workshop 2021](https://events.libre.space/event/5/), to be
held online on December 9-10.

Per Python ad astra!
