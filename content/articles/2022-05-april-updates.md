We call them April updates but we've mostly started working in May,
allow us this small inconsistency ðŸ˜‰

Juan Luis will give a talk about poliastro at SciPy US 2022 in Austin, Texas, USA!
We are thrilled to have this opportunity to present almost a decade of work in such an important event,
and we have already started
[working on a full conference paper](https://github.com/poliastro/scipy_proceedings/tree/poliastro/papers/juanluis_cano_poliastro)
as well,
with a draft hopefully ready by the end of the month.

Since our last update we have published two bugfix releases of poliastro,
the last one being [poliastro 0.16.3](https://docs.poliastro.space/en/v0.16.3/changelog.html#poliastro-0-16-3-2022-05-09),
with documentation improvements and several compatibility fixes with the latest versions of Astropy and Python.
