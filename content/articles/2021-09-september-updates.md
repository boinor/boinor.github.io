Hacktoberfest is coming! We are preparing ourselves for this celebration of open source
by appropriately tagging some open issues and reviewing our contributing documentation.
We have also discussed possible improvements for the development experience,
like [checking for dead code](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/1312),
[dropping some unused CI checks](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/1319)
or [adding a bot that reformats the code](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/1319).

Yash has been struggling with some corner cases
of his [attractor surface visibility](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/1298)
and [satellite visibility](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/1299)
pull requests, we hope to get them to a working state soon.

Finally, we submitted [a proposal](https://github.com/poliastro/documents/blob/master/numfocus-sdg-2021-r3.md)
for the NumFOCUS Small Development Grants, and we hope to see it accepted!
