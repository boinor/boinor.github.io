This month Yash has been wrapping up his Google of Summer of Code work
by adding [eclipse event detection](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/1246),
[node crossing event detection](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/1293),
and [fixing the propagation logic for non-terminal events](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/1288).
Besides, Yash is also writing [a new how-to guide for the event detection](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/1304)
that we hope to get merged soon.
Jorge has been thoroughly reviewing all that work
and [adding validation cases](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/1288) when appropriate.

Libre Space Foundation [published a summary of Yash work](https://libre.space/2021/08/12/gsoc-project-expanding-events-detection-poliastro/),
you can read it on their blog.
